# Exploring_Planets
In this Project, we explore the planets in the solar system using the data from NASA collected by Kepler telescope and filter the habitable ones using certain criteria and standards based on research. 
# DataSet : Kepler telescope data
https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html
Data set included as kepler_data.csv
# Uses Node.js , Js   Package (CSV-Parse) for reading the dataset - NPM Package

Habitable planets are filtered using the below criteria: 
KOI_DISPOSITION : which filters the bodies which are confirmed as planets - which have status as CONFIRMED.
KOI_INSOL: key pieces of information we have available for extrasolar planets to assess their potential habitability is their effective stellar flux.
This is calculated using information about a planet’s orbit and the luminosity of its sun. 
If this effective stellar flux falls within a range corresponding to the limits of a sun’s habitable zone (HZ),this planet has met one of the basic criteria for potential habitability.
KOI_PRAD: Radius of the planet (Checked against the Earth's size)
